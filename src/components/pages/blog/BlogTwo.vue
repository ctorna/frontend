                                        <p>A company’s contact detail is vital to its clients and all of your contact information such as email and contact number are available on your card. When you try to send information through digital devices like iPhones and Androids, it is not always compatible with all the other devices.</p>
                                        <p class="fw-600">Not all of your potential audience may have compatible phones. Which ultimately make these cards essential for all businesses. Even if you are an influencer!</p>
