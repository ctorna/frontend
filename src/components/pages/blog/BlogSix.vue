                                <p>We have already figured out what information needs to be put out. While typography is an important element in any endeavour, it’s especially relevant to business cards.</p>
                                <p>It is of great importance to watch the typography in a business card because the text needs to be completely legible & there is limited space to work with.</p>
                                <p class="fw-600">To get a better understanding, let chop the typography into three fragments.</p>
                                <div class="row mb-3">
                                    <div class="col-lg-5 mb-3 mb-lg-0">
                                        <img src="assets/images/homepage/cards/bespoke/foil/foil-hover.jpg" alt="Size">
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="col-lg-7">
                                        <h3>1. Size</h3>
                                        <p>It must be readable. To maintain readability, all the text in your card should be at least 8 pts.</p>
                                        <p>Remember, you don’t want all your text to be of the same size so feel free to differentiate the text sizes.</p>
                                        <p>Also keep in mind the empty space, if you don’t want your design to be cluttered- keep the text small so that there is breathing space around each & every element.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                        <p>Font of the design could be the deal maker. Fonts influence your personality or your brand identity.</p>
                                        <p>Always choose the font which might resemble your personality or your brand’s or the message you want to put out.</p>
                                        <p>A clean and modern sans-serif, an individualistic and elegant script or a classic timeless serif font. The choice is all yours.</p>

                                <p class="fw-600">Here are some samples of different kinds of fonts you could play with to enhance your design.</p>
                                <p>The font could partially depend upon the stream of field of work you are in.</p>
                                <p>If you are a lawyer you would opt for the subtle colours and design & choose a more formal font rather than a funky looking floral visiting card.</p>
                                <p>Selecting the font on the basis of the relevant work that you do provides a better design for the card.</p>

                                <p>Staying on brand, choosing text colors that compliment the background color of your card, which would in fact should also be a brand color.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes, some colors might look beautiful together but can be hard to read, so experiment with contrasts for legibility.</p>
