                                <h2>How did it all began?</h2>
                                <p>Before diving into the specifics let's go back and explore how it all began?</p>
                                <p>It all began with PRINTING. When Johannes Gutenberg introduced printing to Europe, even he couldn’t have fathomed the impact of the same even centuries later. </p>
                                <p>What we call business cards today were called presentation cards back then. These were very popular in the 17th century.</p>

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="col-md-7">
                                        <p>Here is a business card of the President of America- Abraham Lincoln. It reads “ My old customer, and others, are no doubt aware of the terrible time I have had in CROSSING THE STREAM, and will be glad to know that I will be back, on the same side from which I started, on or before the FOURTH OF MARCH NEXT, when I will be ready to SWAP HORSES, DISPENSE LAW, MAKE JOKES, SPLIT RAILS, and perform other matters in a small way”.</p>
                                        <p>Even in the 17th century, business cards were largely used by a majority of aristocrats in Europe. The size of these cards were similar to poker cards. There was a trend of engraving the card with gold typefaces.</p>
                                        <p>The cards were used by the footmen of the aristocrat and the servants of the host, to announce the arrival of a distinguished guest.</p>
                                        <p>By the 19th century, more and more people started using it and it became the ‘essential’ item.  People used to have silver card trays in the hall of their houses along with a pen and a piece of paper. So, when someone popped up to visit, it served as a catalogue of those who visited the house before.</p>
